# Live code

This repository is for live coding with TidalCycles and Hydra.

# Startup instructions

1. Follow instructions to install TidalCycles [here](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install). Note that when I tried to install it I had to reinstall `xcode-select` even though I already had it installed to get it working.
2. Open SuperCollider and make sure SuperDirt starts.
3. Open up a `.tidal` file with Pulsar
4. Start TidalCycles by clicking the packages dropdown going to TidalCycles and booting booting it.
5. Hit shift+enter to run one line and ctrl+enter to evaluate multiple lines.
