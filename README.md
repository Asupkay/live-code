# Live code

This repository is for live coding with TidalCycles and Hydra.

# Startup instructions

1. Follow instructions to install TidalCycles [here](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install). Note that when I tried to install it I had to reinstall `xcode-select` even though I already had it installed to get it working.
2. Open SuperCollider and make sure SuperDirt starts by adding startup.scd to startup script `File>Open startup script`..
3. Open up a `.tidal` file with Pulsar
4. Start TidalCycles by clicking the packages dropdown going to TidalCycles and booting booting it.
5. Open a `.js` file with Pulsar
6. Start atom-hydra by clicking the packages dropdown going to atom-hydra and clicking toggle.
7. Hit shift+enter to run one line and ctrl+enter to evaluate multiple lines.
